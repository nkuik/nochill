# I've got `no chill`

To describe my no chill personality, I need to bring in some background from psychology.

## The Big Five

The Big Five is a personality model that is widely accepted in the field of psychology. It is a model that describes five personality traits that are thought to be the most important in describing personality. The five traits are:

1. Openness to experience
2. Conscientiousness
3. Extraversion
4. Agreeableness
5. Neuroticism

I'm not going to go into depth of all five of these, but you can read about the Big Five in greater depth [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits).

These five traits are measured in a variety of ways, but the most common is through self-report questionnaires. The most common of these is the [NEO-PI-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory), which is a 240-item questionnaire that measures the five traits. The NEO-PI-R is a well-validated measure of personality, and is the most commonly used measure of the Big Five. As I note later in the post, there are free ways to take similar assessments online that provide just as much value.

If you've heard of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, you might see some of the same words/concepts being used. In the Myers-Briggs assessment, the assessment taker is given a four-letter code when finished that is supposed to describe their personality. The Big Five assessments are different than the Meyers-Briggs, in that they are not binary (e.g. you are either `E` for extrovert OR `I` for introvert, nothing in between), and score along a continuum represented by a percentage (e.g. You score 35% on extraversion).

I don't want to go to much down this rabbit hole, and we will be sticking largely with the Big Five on this site.

The Big Five are also broken down into smaller characteristics or tendencies, and these are called _facets_ – more on this later.

## Measuring the Big Five

As mentioned, there are a number of assessments measuring the Big Five. The "big ones" (like the NEO-PI-R and the NEO PI-3) that are used in research and also sometimes by workplaces when doing job interviews (which I find possibly problematic).

But for the layperson, other solutions exist. One really great resource is the site [Personality Assessor](https://www.personalityassessor.com/), which was created by personality researcher [Nathan W. Hudson](https://www.nathanwhudson.com/). Here it's possible to complete free assessments, which include assessments measuring the Big Five, how your personality changes over time, and more.

Dr. Hudson focuses specifically on how personalities change over time, so his research is also really interesting.

I highly recommend checking out the site, and it will be the place where I complete assessments on myself for this site.

## What is a "good" personality?

So what kind of combinations of personality traits are "better" than others? Of course this question is completely stupid. The assessment assigns no judgment to any trait – it only measures where a person lies on the continuum of each trait.

However, this is not to say that humans in general do not prefer specific amounts of a trait versus another. Take extroversion for example. Western society tends to prefer a person that is more extroverted.

In her book _Quiet_, Susan Cain goes to great lengths to try to convince readers that introverts are just as valuable humans as extroverts. This kind of book would be pointless if there wasn't an existing societal preference for extroversion.

Neuroticism is another example. Neuroticism is a trait that is associated with negative emotions, like anxiety and depression, and it is also associated with a tendency to ruminate, or think about things over and over again.

Moreover, it is generally associated to an exaggerated stress response based on "everyday" situations.  Neurotic people are not the most popular kids in high school, a time when our evolutionary tribalism is untamed and unmediated – although someone's "popularity in high school" is also a really shitty metric for anything, and people have different needs and desires for social interaction, such as what they consider a "good" friend and how many of these they need.

We might say that some of the traits are more prosocial than others, such as high extroversion and high agreeableness, and those with a higher degree of prosocial traits are more likely to "get on" with others (i.e. are okay to hang out with).

## My `no chill` Personality Cocktail

So how is my personality so `no chill`? I only have my subjective experience and scores from assessments such as the IPIP-300, the longest Big Five assessment on Personality Assessor. I will save you a deep dive into the dirty laundry of all my assessment results, however, I do need to reveal a bit about my 'no chill' traits.

Obviously this is a non-scientific assessment, and the literature says different things about the "outcomes" for people with different trait combinations.

Here are the three traits that I think make me `no chill` (and how I score on them):

1. Neuroticism: "very high"
2. Conscientiousness: "high"
3. Extraversion: "very low"

**add screenshot of my results?**

I've ranked them in a _very_ scientific by how much they make me `no chill`.

Neuroticism is the epitome of `no chill`. From Wikipedia:

> In the Big Five approach to personality trait theory, individuals with high scores for neuroticism are more likely than average to be moody and to experience such feelings as anxiety, worry, fear, anger, frustration, envy, jealousy, pessimism, guilt, depressed mood, and loneliness.<sup>1</sup>

Wow, not exactly the laid back, longed hair, "hang loose" motioning surfer dude archetype.

There is also an interplay between the different traits. As Ozer and Benet-Martinez (2006)<sup>2</sup> write:

>Specifically, individuals high in extraversion and low in neuroticism tend to see events and situations in a more positive light, are less responsive to negative feedback, and tend to discount opportunities that are not available to them.

I feel inversely personally attacked.

## Face the Facets

Digging a bit deeper into the facets of the three traits I mention also provides (possible) insight.

For instance, while conscientiousness is likely a trait useful for building social connections, I score particularly high on the facets "Orderliness" and "Dutifulness". While these could help me be a good roommate, for example, they can also lead to me me being a bit of a bit control freak.

Another one of my interesting facets scores is self-consciousness, which is a facet of neuroticism, and I score in the 86th percentile ("very high"). Self-consciousness has always been a sore spot for me.

Let's take the one of my `no chill` examples: anxiety about not having the correct things packed for summer basketball camp.

The rationale for this anxiety could be many things, such as not having packed that _one thing_ that will make summer camp even more fun or perhaps might improve one's playing performance. For me, it was squarely how me forgetting something might make me look stupid in front of others.

Someone might just call this social anxiety, which may be true, but when the experiences feel related to one's core in some way, such an explanation feels a bit reductionist, or at least not particularly validating or even helpful.

But that is enough about me. Let's talk about you -- Join the discussion [here](some link)
