# What is the purpose of this site?

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this nagging feeling. A feeling that I want to let go, to be more flexible, but I simply _can’t_; something holds me back that I cannot shake.

I _just so want_ to walk up and talk to that person without feeling really awkward
I _just so want_ to not feel really uptight in that mildly intense driving session
I _just so want_ to avoid my face flushing when giving a presentation to my colleagues
I _just so want_ to stop freaking out on the first day of summer basketball camp and not be anxious to the point of having a stomachache because I’m not sure I packed everything
I _just so want_ to not get worked up by a message in my work’s group chat that probably wasn’t meant the way I’m interpreting it
I _just so want_ to do a chore around the house without feeling bitter that my roommate/partner didn’t see it…

The list could go on, and on, and on, and on -- you get the picture.

And no, "just relax" has never been a helpful piece of advice. Actually, it's extremely frustrating to hear, because that's exactly what I want to do but can't, for some seemingly unknown reason. Moreover, this behavior is not prime friend-making behavior, either. Quite the opposite actually, as if the only possibility is to make friends that are just as high-strung as I am. And if any of this sounds familiar, you likely know that "high-strungity" is contagious and potentiates, so if one person is feeling stressed about something, those with similar predispositions might also start to feel stressed.

The problem isn’t lack of awareness; on the contrary the problem is likely too much awareness, or rather overthinking. But anyone who overthinks knows the paradox about realizing that one is overthinking. How can I stop my overthinking? Think more about how I think less? Oh no, I’m overthinking about overthinking!

This highlights a point that will be made many times over on this site: thinking and behavior are linked, but they are not the same. Despite my desire to relax in what I think _should_ be low-stress situations, I am unable to do so.

There’s always just been way too much chatter in my head, way too much catastrophizing about situations I have no idea will ever come to fruition — simply way too much rumination. This contrary to what other people saw in me, which was a shy, reserved individual that might open up the more they got to know me. In reality, I wanted to act more freely and spontaneously, but I had (and still have) great difficulty doing so.

# no chill

And this is where I find the name for this site. The current [Wiktionary entry] for `no chill` is this: `1. (slang) Absence of calm; acting without regard to how others feel or see one.`

Considering my introduction, you can see that I’m basically ignoring the definition after the semicolon for my own benefit, as I don’t feel like these two descriptions are that well related. Yet, I am a millennial, so I could easily be missing the mark with my entire site — uh oh, _feelings of uptight, anxious dread setting in_.

That aside, when I heard `no chill` for the first time, I thought, “Huh, that is basically the way I feel almost 100% of the time.”

Let’s not get too hung up on the existing definitions. As I’ll go into detail in other posts, `no chill` is a slangy encapsulation of actual personality trait(s). What is important now is for me to describe what this site is. Allow me to start by describing what this site _is not_:

* An annoying dime-a-dozen self-help, self-improvement, coaching “I wake up at 4am every morning” kind of site
* A research literature review site
* A site built to tell or encourage you to change you or your personality

While not defined completely at this point, this site _is_:

* A one-man-show
* A narrative meandering of sorts through the process of ultimately accepting who we are and maybe trying some new things
* A blog and a newsletter (at least for now)
* Maybe a place where we might get better at not taking ourselves so seriously, in a positive way

My intended audience includes people like me who want to have more chill, but seem to have specific barriers to it that feel hard/impossible to overcome. However, we are all human, so maybe something somewhere in here is amusing/rings true/annoys you so much you close the browser tab and your laptop because you can’t one single more word. Whatever your use case, I hope it’s somehow helpful.
