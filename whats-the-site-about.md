# What is the purpose of this site?

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had this nagging feeling. A feeling that I want to let go, but I simply _can’t_, something is holding me back that I cannot shake.

I _just so want_ to be able to talk to that person that seems interesting; I _just so want_ to not lose my shit in that mildly intense driving session; I _just so want_ to avoid my face becoming flushed when giving a presentation to my colleagues; I _just so want_ to stop freaking out on the first day of summer basketball camp and not be anxious to the point of having a stomachache because I’m not sure I packed everything; I _just so want_ to not get worked up by a message in my work’s group chat that probably wasn’t meant the way I’m interpreting it; I _just so want_ to do a chore around the house without feeling bitter that my roommate/partner didn’t see it…

The list could go on, and on, and on, and on. You get the picture, I hope.

The problem isn’t lack of awareness; on the contrary the problem is likely too much awareness, or rather overthinking. But anyone who overthinks knows the paradox about knowing that one overthinks. What am I supposed to do about my overthinking? Think more about how I think less?

This highlights a point that will be made many times over: thinking and behavior are connected, but they are not the same. Despite all my desire to be able to relax in what I felt were everyday situations.

There’s always just been way too much chatter in my head, way too much running through scenarios that end badly that I have no idea will ever come to fruition — just way too much rumination.

And this is where I find the name for this site. The current [Wiktionary entry] for `no chill`is this: `1. (slang) Absence of calm; acting without regard to how others feel or see one.`

Considering my introduction, you can see that I’m basically ignoring the definition after the semicolon for my own benefit, as I don’t feel like these two descriptions are that well related. Yet, I am a millennial, so I could easily be missing the mark with my entire site — uh oh, _feelings of uptight, anxious dread setting in_.

That aside, when I heard `no chill` for the first time, I was thinking, “Huh, that is basically the way I feel.”

Let’s not get too hung up on the existing definitions. As I’ll go into detail in other posts, `no chill` is a slangy encapsulation of actual personality trait(s). What is important now is for me to describe what this site is. Allow me to start by describing what this site _is not_:

* An annoying dime-a-dozen self-help, self-improvement, coaching “I wake up at 4am every morning” kind of site
* A research literature review site
* A site built to tell you how to change yourself

While not defined completely at this point, this site _is_:

* A one-man-show
* A narrative meandering of sorts through the process of ultimately accepting who we are and maybe trying some new things
* only a blog for now

My intended audience includes people like me who want to have more chill, but seem to have specific barriers to it that feel hard/impossible to overcome. However, we are all human, so maybe something somewhere in here is amusing/rings true/annoys you so much you close the browser tab and your laptop because you can’t one single more word. Whatever your use case, I hope it’s somehow helpful.
