# I've got no chill

To describe my no chill personality, I need to bring in some background from psychology.

## The Big Five

The Big Five is a personality model that is widely accepted in the field of psychology. It is a model that describes five personality traits that are thought to be the most important in describing personality. The five traits are:

1. Openness to experience
2. Conscientiousness
3. Extraversion
4. Agreeableness
5. Neuroticism

I'm not going to go into depth of all five of these, but you can read about the Big Five in greater depth [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits).

These five traits are measured in a variety of ways, but the most common is through self-report questionnaires. The most common of these is the [NEO-PI-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revised_NEO_Personality_Inventory), which is a 240-item questionnaire that measures the five traits. The NEO-PI-R is a well-validated measure of personality, and is the most commonly used measure of the Big Five. Also I note later in the post, there are free ways to take similar assessments online that provide just as much value.

If you've heard of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, you might see some of the same words/concepts being used. In the Myers-Briggs assessment, the assessment taker is given a four-letter code when finished that is supposed to describe their personality. The Big Five are different in that they are not dichotomous (i.e. you score on a gradient of `Extroversion`, low to high, instead of being one of two options, `Extroverted` or `Introverted`). I don't want to go to much down this rabbit hole, and we will be sticking largely with the Big Five on this site.

The Big Five are also broken down into smaller characteristics or tendencies, and these are called _facets_.

## Measuring the Big Five

As mentioned, there are a number of assessments measuring the Big Five. The "big ones" (like the NEO-PI-R and the NEO PI-3) that are used in research and also sometimes by workplaces when doing job interviews (ðŸ™„).
